# AI-Powered Job Recommendation System 💼🤖
- This project is an AI-powered job recommendation system that provides personalized job recommendations based on user input such as skills, experience, and job preferences. The system uses machine learning techniques to match user profiles with job listings.

## Project Overview 📝
- This project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to recommend the best job listings to users. It compares the user's skills and experience with the job descriptions using the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity, ensuring relevant matches.

## Key Features
-User profile input for personalized recommendations ✍️
- TF-IDF vectorization for job description analysis 📊
- Cosine similarity to match jobs to user profiles 🔍
- Flask for backend services and user interaction 💻

## Project Structure 📂
- The project includes the following major components:
- User Input: Collects user details such as name, skills, experience, and location.
- Job Data: Contains job listings with descriptions, locations, and job types.
- Recommendation Engine: Matches users to jobs using vectorization and similarity scores.
- Flask Web Application: A simple Flask interface for user interaction.

## Project Report 📊
## Objectives 🎯
- The main objective of this project is to assist job seekers by providing AI-powered job recommendations. The system aims to:
- Enhance the job search experience.
- Provide relevant job listings based on a candidate's profile.
- Save time by narrowing down suitable opportunities.

## Methodology 🛠️
- User Profile Creation: Inputs such as skills, experience, and job type are gathered.
- Job Data Preparation: A dataset of job listings is created, including job descriptions.
- Similarity Calculation: TF-IDF vectorizer transforms text data, and cosine similarity measures the closeness between user skills and job descriptions.
- Job Recommendations: Jobs are ranked based on similarity scores.

## Future Enhancements 🔮
- Add more advanced filtering options (e.g., salary range, company).
- Implement user authentication and profile saving.
- Use larger datasets with real-world job listings.
